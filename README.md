# Advent of Code 2025

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome!

### Project Structure
- Each day/problem should have its **own package**, e.g.:
```java
  org.day1
  org.day2
```
- Each solution should have its **own class**, e.g.:

```java
Day1Solution1.java
Day1Solution2.java
Day2Solution1.java
```

- Keep code self-contained and CLI-friendly for quick testing.
